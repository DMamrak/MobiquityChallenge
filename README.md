# MobiquityChallenge

### How to run:
Everything you need is in this repository, no additional dependensies (server, node modules etc.) needed. Please just clone the repo and open index.html in browser you like.

### Several remarks:
* Using bootstrap for a small app like this looks like a kind of overkill, so I've made everything myself, including responsive layout and icons.
* According to our previous conversation I assumed this app to be an AngularJS app, so I used AngularJS for validation (there's a great set of tools for that).
* Liquid layout has 3 breakpoints to make it look better on devices of different screen size.
